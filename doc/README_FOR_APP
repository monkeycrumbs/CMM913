Required Gems

* Install RMagick

** Windows

Download rmagick to temporary folder - http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/38052/RMagick-2.5.0-ImageMagick-6.4.1-5-Q8.zip

Double-click the ImageMagick installer (ImageMagick-6.4.1-5-Q8-windows-dll.exe) found in the temporary directory. The only option that you need to choose from the installation options is "Update executable search path." The other options are up to you. Do not use any other version of ImageMagick. RMagick will not run if you install any other version of ImageMagick.

Make sure RubyGems is up-to-date. If you are using an older version, update it now. Enter the command

    * gem update --system

Installing the gem is very simple. Start a Command Prompt window. Use the chdir command to make the temporary directory that contains the unzipped files the current directory. Enter this command:

    * gem install rmagick --local

You should see:

    * Successfully installed rmagick, version 2.5.0-x86-mswin32

* Install Gruff

gem install gruff

* Install fastercsv

gem install fastercsv

* Install Selenium

   1. Install Selenium on Rails: script/plugin install http://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-on-rails/selenium-on-rails
   2. If you‘re on Windows, gem install win32-open3
   3. If the RedCloth gem is available the Selenese test cases can use it for better markup.
   4. Run the Rakefile in the plugin‘s directory to run the tests in order to see that everything works. (If RedCloth isn‘t installed a few tests will fail since they assume RedCloth is installed.)
   5. Create a test case: script/generate selenium login
   6. Start the server: script/server -e test
   7. Point your browser to localhost:3000/selenium
   8. If everything works as expected you should see the Selenium test runner. The north east frame contains all your test cases (just one for now), and the north frame contains your test case.
